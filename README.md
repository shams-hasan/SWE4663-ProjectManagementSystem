### SWE4663-ProjectManagementSystem
Welcome to the Group 3 Repository! This is the central hub for all project-related materials, including:

* Source code

* Documentation

## What is our Software?
A comprehensive Project Management System designed to help teams:

* Track, organize, and monitor software development projects.

* Input project details, functional/non-functional requirements, and log effort hours across phases (requirements, design, coding, testing, management).

* Manage tasks with priority labels and color-coded statuses (To-Do, In Progress, Complete, Overdue).

* Visualize progress via analytics and reporting (weekly trends, exportable data).

## Project Objectives
* Streamline tracking: Monitor hours spent per phase (requirements, design, etc.).

* Enhance task management: Priority labels (Low/Medium/High), filtering, and status indicators.

* Enable collaboration: Invite team members to projects/workspaces.
  
* Provide insights: Weekly reports on completion trends, project status, and priorities.

* Ensure usability: Customizable settings, notifications, and dashboard views.

## Features We Are Building
* User Authentication:

  * Signup, login, profile management (email, password, username).

* Project & Task Management:

  * Add projects/tasks, set priorities, track statuses.

* Effort Tracking:

  * Log hours per phase (requirements, design, coding, testing, management).

* Collaboration:

  * Invite team members to projects or the entire workspace.

* Dashboard & Reports:

  * Filter tasks by date, view weekly analytics (completion trends, statuses).
